*** An Org mode task repeater based on Cron expressions

Modified from [[https://github.com/Raemi/org-reschedule-by-rule]].

Key Differences:

- Uses a cron parser implemented in pure Elisp, with no dependency on the Python croniter package.
  
- Replaces the =INTERVAL= property with a =DAY_AND= property.
  
- Supports toggling between SCHEDULED and DEADLINE timestamps.
  

=org-repeat-by-cron.el= is a lightweight extension for Emacs Org
mode that allows you to repeat tasks based on powerful Cron expressions.

Standard Org mode repeaters (like =+1d= , =++1w= ) are based on the current =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= timestamp. In contrast, this tool provides a repetition method based on absolute time rules. You can easily set a task to repeat "on the last Friday of every month" or "on the first Monday of each quarter" without manual date calculations.

A core advantage of this tool is its pure Elisp implementation, which does not rely on any external programs (like Python's =croniter= library), ensuring it works out-of-the-box in any Emacs environment.

* Features

- Define complex repetition rules using standard 5-field Cron expressions (minute, hour, day, month, day of week).
  
- Pure Elisp implementation with no external dependencies for simple installation and efficient operation.
  
- Supports extended Cron syntax:
  
  - =L= : Represents the "last day" of the month.
    
  - =W= : Represents the nearest "weekday".
    
  - =#= : Represents the "Nth day-of-week X", e.g., =5#2= means the second Friday.
    
  
- Supports toggling the logic between the "day of month" and "day of week" fields using the =DAY_AND= property (default is =OR= ).
  
- Supports English abbreviations for months ( =JAN-DEC= ) and days of the week ( =SUN-SAT= ) for improved readability.
  
- You can choose to update the task's =SCHEDULED= timestamp or =DEADLINE= timestamp (defaults to =SCHEDULED= ).
  

* Installation and Configuration

Install via Melpa or by manually downloading the =org-repeat-by-cron.el= file.

The recommended configuration is as follows:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-repeat-by-cron
  :ensure t  ; If the file is already in your load-path
  :config
  (global-org-repeat-by-cron-mode))
#+end_src

* Usage

To make an Org task repeat according to a Cron rule, simply add the =REPEAT_CRON= property to its =PROPERTIES= drawer.
** Usage Example

Suppose we have a weekly course:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Weekend Course
:PROPERTIES:
:REPEAT_CRON: "* * SAT,SUN"
:END:
#+end_src

When it is marked as done, it will automatically be scheduled to a date that meets the conditions. Taking today (December 9, 2025) as an example, it will be scheduled for this Saturday (December 13, 2025):

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Weekend Course
SCHEDULED: <2025-12-13 Sat>
:PROPERTIES:
:REPEAT_CRON: "* * SAT,SUN"
:REPEAT_ANCHOR: 2025-12-13 Sat
:END:
#+end_src

Then, if it is marked as done again, it will calculate the next qualifying time point based on the =REPEAT_ANCHOR= and the current time, and schedule it accordingly:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Weekend Course
SCHEDULED: <2025-12-14 Sun>
:PROPERTIES:
:REPEAT_CRON: "* * SAT,SUN"
:REPEAT_ANCHOR: 2025-12-14 Sun
:END:
#+end_src

Note: If you do not want to specify the hour and minute for the repeat time, use the abbreviated 3-segment format. For a detailed discussion, see the later section.
** Core Properties

- =REPEAT_CRON= : ( *Required* ) A string containing the Cron expression.
  
  - *5-field format*: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week (e.g., =0 9 * * *= for every day at 9:00 AM).
    
  - *3-field format*: day-of-month month day-of-week (default to day task, no =HH:MM=  ).
    
    - Note: In Emacs, =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= timestamps may omit the hours and minutes. To account for this scenario, we use a three‑field format to quickly specify tasks to the day.
    
- =REPEAT_DAY_AND= : (Optional) If set to t, the "day of month" and "day of week" fields must both be satisfied ( =AND= logic). If not set or set to any other value, only one of them needs to be satisfied ( =OR= logic, which is standard Cron behavior).
  
- =REPEAT_DEADLINE= : (Optional) If set to t, the task's =DEADLINE= timestamp will be updated when completed. Otherwise, the =SCHEDULED= timestamp is updated by default.
  
** Workflow

- Add the =REPEAT_CRON= property and set your Cron expression under an Org heading.
  
- (Optional) Add =REPEAT_DAY_AND= or =REPEAT_DEADLINE= as needed.
  
- Change the task's =TODO= state to =DONE= as you normally would.
  
- What happens automatically:
  
  - =org-repeat-by-cron= detects the state change.
    
  - It calculates the next valid time based on the =REPEAT_CRON= rule.
    
  - It updates the task's =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= timestamp.
    
  - It resets the task's =TODO= state from =DONE= back to =TODO= (or your default initial state).
    

*Tip:* You should not use =org-repeat-by-cron= and the built-in Org repeater cookie (e.g., +1w) on the same task.

* Cron Syntax Explained

A Cron expression consists of 5 fields, separated by spaces.

| Field        |                           Allowed Values | Allowed Special Characters |
|--------------+------------------------------------------+----------------------------|
| Minute       |                                     0-59 | \* , - /                   |
| Hour         |                                     0-23 | \* , - /                   |
| Day of Month |                                     1-31 | \* , - / ? L W             |
| Month        |                          1-12 or JAN-DEC | \* , - /                   |
| Day of Week  | 0-7 (0 and 7 are both Sunday) or SUN-SAT | \* , - / ? L #             |

** Special Characters

| Character | Description                     | Example                                                           |
| \*        | Matches any value in the field. | \* in the "hour" field means "every hour".                        |
| ,         | Separates multiple values.      | 1,15 in the "day" field means "on the 1st and 15th of the month". |
| \-        | Defines a range.                | MON-FRI in the "day of week" field means "from Monday to Friday". |
| \/        | Defines a step value.           | \*/15 in the "minute" field means "every 15 minutes".             |

** Extended Syntax (Highlight Features)

- =L=
  
  - *"Last"*. In the "day of month" field, L means the last day of the month. In the "day of week" field, 5L means the last Friday of the month.
    
  - =L= (day) -> Jan 31st, =L6= (day of week) -> the last Saturday of the month.
    
  
- =W=
  
  - *"Weekday"* (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. =15W= will find the nearest weekday to the 15th. If the 15th is a Saturday, it matches the 14th (Friday); if the 15th is a Sunday, it matches the 16th (Monday). It does not cross months: if the 1st is a Saturday, =1W= will match the 3rd (Monday); if the 31st is a Sunday, =31W= will match the 29th (Friday).
    
  
- =LW=
  
  - *"Last weekday of the month"* .
    
  
- =#=
  
  - *"The Nth day of week in the month"*. Format:  =DOW#N= .
    
  - =5#2= -> The second Friday. =1#1,1#3= -> The 1st and 3rd Monday.
